    <p>The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; 
        Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, 
        collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. 
        The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture,
         and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, 
         juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas 
         are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.

        The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of 
        Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought
         from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced,
          in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry
           species cultivated in the early 17th century.[3]
        
        From a botanical point of view, the strawberry is not a berry but an aggregate accessory fruit,
         meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle
          that holds the ovaries.[4] Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually
           one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.[4]
        
        In 2019, world production of strawberries was nine million tons, led by China with 40% of the total.
        The strawberry succeeds in a surprisingly wide range of soils and situations and, compared with
         other horticultural crops, has a low fertilizer requirement. It is, however, susceptible to 
         drought and requires moisture-retaining soil or irrigation by furrow or sprinkler. Additionally, 
         the plants are susceptible to nematodes and pathogenic soil fungi, and many growers sterilize the
         soil with chemicals such as methyl bromide prior to planting. Runner plants are planted in early 
         autumn if a crop is required the next year. If planted in winter or spring, the plants are 
         deblossomed to avoid a weakening crop the first year. Plants are usually retained for one to 
         four years. Runners may be removed from the spaced plants, or a certain number may be allowed 
         to form a matted row alongside the original parent plants. In areas with severe winters, plants
          are put out in the spring 
        and protected during the following winters by covering the rows with straw or other mulches.
